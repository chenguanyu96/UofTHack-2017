# UofTHacks 2017
This repository is for UofTHacks IV 2017 RCAF challenge. It includes code that is still in development and concepts. The missions is as follows:
1. Given a set of images with real targets please formulate a creative way of finding these targets using free/open source software and web services
2. Can a cell phone capability in a dead zone (with no cellular service) be utilized to help the air force pinpoint that target?
## Mission 1
This mission was accomplished by using a combination of NumPy and Clarifai API. We used Clarifai API for image recognition and to get the appropriate models. NumPy is very helpful to do image processing, for example, convert images into a heatmap or do other kind of filters on the image.

This project is still ongoing, we are working with a bigger team to hopfully get a working prototype in order to recieve funding to further develop this algorithm/product.

## Mission 2
